This is bloody complicated - but hopefully it's all going to make sense soon!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By only adding the files that hold the logical change to the commit

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It puts all the bits from both branches together - because that is the correct representation of how it happens.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Saves time
