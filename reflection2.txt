This is bloody complicated - but hopefully it's all going to make sense soon!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I honestly have no clue how this will be of any benefit in practical coding right now, maybe I'll answer this later in the lesson.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By only adding the files that hold the logical change to the commit

<change added to test commit>
