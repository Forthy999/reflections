How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I could easily use the software and found it was fairly easy topick through the differences in the file and find the typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By giving meaccess to working modules from software so that I don't have to write everything from scratch

By keeping working versions when adding new features to make sure i don't loose everything.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros are that you get just the right number of commits.

Cons are that youmight miss a save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

So you can track your whole project, and teh associated changes within.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log shows all the files that have been committed, and diff shows the differences between a selcted two.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because I can easily go back and fix the problem.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

To use version control on my own projects.
