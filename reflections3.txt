When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that I can access the work from multiple points and devices, and so other people can work on it without me having to stay online or set up an VPS link for them to myown devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I'm not sure??  Seemsto me you would always want both repositories sync'd as often as possible so that you always have the most up-to-date versions?
