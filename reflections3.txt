When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So that I can access the work from multiple points and devices, and so other people can work on it without me having to stay online or set up an VPS link for them to myown devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I'm not sure??  Seemsto me you would always want both repositories sync'd as often as possible so that you always have the most up-to-date versions?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are a copy of somebody else repository on github that you beging to work on independently

Clones are copies of repositories in teh state they are when you issue the clone command

Branches are deifferent versions of the same things all within the same repository.

I would use each one for its intended function.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Being as upt to date as possble prevents merge conflicts down the road.
